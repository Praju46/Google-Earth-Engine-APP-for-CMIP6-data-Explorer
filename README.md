## Overview

The CMIP6 Climate Data Explorer is an interactive web application developed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for visualizing global climate data. This tool allows users to explore climate projections, focusing on temperature and precipitation data from the CMIP6 models under different scenarios. Users can generate time series data by selecting areas of interest on the map and compare historical and future climate trends for various models and scenarios.

Try the App here:https://ee-prajaktamali1298.projects.earthengine.app/view/cmip6datatrend


## Features

- Visualize Historical and Future Climate Data: Explore temperature and precipitation trends from 1950 to 2100.
- Draw Polygons, Rectangles, or Select Points: Generate time series data by drawing shapes or selecting specific points on the map.
- Scenario Comparison: Switch between climate scenarios (e.g., SSP245, SSP585, Historical) for detailed analysis.
- Layered Map View: View different climate variables and customize visibility based on your analysis needs.
- Supports Various Models: Models include ACCESS-CM2 and MPI-ESM1-2-HR. (Note: Minimum and maximum temperature data are unavailable for IITM-ESM.)

## Data Sources

The app uses data from the NASA GDDP-CMIP6 dataset, including:
- Temperature: Minimum (tasmin) and Maximum (tasmax) temperature
- Precipitation: Precipitation rate (pr)

Explore more about the dataset on [NASA's EarthData website](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/).
